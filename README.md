# Stack

Stack is a data structure in computer science in which any operation is performed according to LIFO (last-in-first-out) principle, in which the last thing added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped). When the stack is full trying to push more will result in stack overflow, whereas when the stack is empty trying to pop will result in stack underflow.
